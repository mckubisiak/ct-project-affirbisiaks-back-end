.KUBISIAK
A queer trans Software Engineer. I love mutually developing with people and supporting everyone's common as well as individuals goals. Photography and Mutual Aid are other avenues I like to participate in community.

DJ DRAKOS
A Full-stack Engineer, whole systems thinker, and art school dropout. I love solving a good logic puzzle and filtering signal from noise. Sometimes I knit, bike, or sleep, as needed.

ISAAC EWING
I am a Full-stack Developer who loves to solve complex coding problems involving math. In my free time I enjoy playing various sports with my friends poorly, reading, and playing video games (also poorly). I originally became interested in programming when I decided that I didn't want to use my degree in Chemical Engineering, and within a few days of first writing code, I knew that I wanted to do it professionally.

SEAN SIMPSON
Software Dev.  Player of Guitar.  Pun afficianado.
I churn butter the hard way.


MISSAEL ORTIZ
A full-stack software engineer, professional storyteller, and full time nerd. I enjoy working with people and establishing deep interpersonal connections as well as playing an unhealthy amount of games of all kind, digital and analog.
